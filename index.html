            <h3 class="lb_heading">Chamber - Sentinel</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                The Frenchman Vincent Fabron lives his life in search of one necessary goal, willing to sacrifice anything that gets in his way of achieving it. He has spent much of 
                his time involved with combat and weapons, having worked for the French military before becoming a PMC marksman and then a weapons designer for Kingdom Defense. His 
                employment at Kingdom was only a stepping stone for him though, as by this point he was already set on his path in pursuit of his sacred truth.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                With a blend of suave nonchalance, professional poise, and smug comedy, Chamber is fully confident with the skill he provides and the value that he offers. He sets
                high standards for himself and his team, reminding everyone that if they were to secure victories, they might as well go all-out and be the best in what they do.
                He has shown friendliness with many of the agents in the Protocol, but he is very much aware that he holds many secrets which are better kept hidden.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Jett - Duelist</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Sunwoo Han (Korean: 한선우) hails from South Korea, with possible links to the Insa-dong neighborhood in Seoul. As a chef in her early life, she was involved in an 
                incident relating to her wind-like radiant powers at the restaurant she worked at, causing a "freak storm" that all but destroyed the building. Sunwoo fled the scene 
                soon after.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                The wind is commonly known for being cool, but Jett is an aggressive agent who has a distinctive, sarcastic personality. Jett also has a cheeky, childish "in-your-face" 
                attitude, seen commonly giving insults for feats she makes on the team and is always spouting her sheer amount of arrogance. Her self-confidence may feel as if she is 
                disregarding her comrades' safety, but she has recognized that it is best to play with a team, albeit with some reluctance. She does show a much more friendly 
                personality towards teammates. Her youth is apparent as she animatedly chats with her allies, and she can sometimes spitball whenever she's excited to share ideas.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Sova - Initiator</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Hailing from the town of Severomorsk, in Murmansk Oblast, Russia, Sasha Novikov (Russian: Саша Новиков) is an archer who became an agent for the VALORANT Protocol as 
                its sixth recruit, "Sova". With his right eye replaced with a mechanical one after he lost it, Sova primarily serves as the team's scout, gathering information and 
                searching for targets using olden methods should technology come up short. Being highly capable and reliable both in the field and with his work, whilst also having 
                experience with multiple radianite-related events (having traveled through a rift and having met his Omega counterpart), Sova has earned a reputation of being one of 
                the Protocol's most trusted agents, especially to the organization's commander, Brimstone.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                A humble hunter that has taken down man and beast alike, Sova works carefully and with precision, scouting around and retrieving information before taking out the 
                enemy. As he has told Phoenix (Agent - 09), Sova believes in the value of patience and strategic thinking. Being the team player that he is, Sova always commends his allies and 
                never hesitates to voice out his vote of confidence in them. He seems to value the team to the point of risking his own life, to which Brimstone reminds him that it 
                is equally important that he looks out after himself.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Sage - Sentinel</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Ling Ying Wei (Chinese: 魏玲瑩) is a Radiant monk coming from China. Going on to become an agent for the VALORANT Protocol as its seventh recruit, "Sage", Ling was 
                able to work her way quickly up the ranks, with the Protocol's superiors identifying natural leadership qualities in her. Sage is currently active in VALORANT's 
                radiant agent recruitment and training, interacting with multiple new radiants upon recruitment and taking the lead on its radiant training program.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Described as a stronghold, Sage is an agent who always looks out for her teammates and offers help whenever she can. She has fully embraced her powers which give her 
                control of life, and wishes to use them to keep her team alive for as long as possible. Calmer and more collected than some of her more energetic allies, Sage always 
                imparts encouraging words to rally the team up and guide them to victory.

            <p class="lb_text">
                Sabine Callas hails from the United States, with possible links to Seattle. Holding a doctorate and awards such as the R. Francis Prize and the Denton Outstanding<br>
                Innovation Award, her previous occupations include roles with Kingdom Corporation, eventually becoming its first Chief Scientific Officer on the board of advisors,<br>
                and influence over the conglomerate's ventures in Rabat, Morocco. At some point during her time there however, there was an "incident". Little is known about what <br>
                happened, but everything changed for Callas at that point after all she lost because of it, leading her to isolate and dedicate herself to pursuing vengeance instead.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Viper is a savage and confident agent who doesn't fear enemies, and in fact desires the enemies' fear. She does not hesitate to call herself a villain and a monster,<br> 
                and will act like both if it means the success of her objective. Just like her abilities, she can be quite "toxic", however she is seen being more amiable and caring <br>
                towards her teammates, but she will not hesitate to reprimand them harshly should they make major miscalculations in the battlefield.<br>
